Dungeon Master is an adventurous text-based game where you must navigate a perilous dungeon, gather essential items, and defeat the mighty dragon. You start at the Dungeon Entrance. There is the Treasure Room, but its door is locked. And the Dark Room blocks your path to the Dragonâ€™s Lair. Armed with your wits and weapons, you must explore, solve challenges, and prepare for the ultimate showdown against the fearsome dragon. Will you emerge victorious, or fall in the depths of doom?

I chose this theme because I was inspired by the anime Solo Leveling, which revolves around dungeon breaks, battling monsters, and defeating the final boss to clear a dungeon. This game follows a similar concept, where players must progress strategically, overcoming obstacles to reach and defeat the final boss dragon in order to win.
